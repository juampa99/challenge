# Preface

Regarding the main assignment:

* The assignment specifies `N` subjects and `N` careers, meaning students or 'leads' are taking the same 
amount of classes as careers they are pursuing. I'll assume `Ns (N of subjects) != Nc (N of careers)` as it wouldn't make much sense otherwise. 

* It also defines N as: `[0, N] ^ [N, X]` but `X` is not defined. I'll assume `X = inf`.
